# Let It Fly

This project is one of the six projects that have been selected amongst over 680 teams to be showcased during the finals in Singapore, during the [Singapore Airlines AppChallenge 2018](https://appchallenge.singaporeair.com/en/challenges/appchallenge-2018).

This repo contains the **code of the final application** that was showcased in the finals in Singapore. It is a React Native proof of concept that integrates all of "Let it fly" features into the official Singapore Airlines application.

The **initial submission video** is available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PAMQNL95pk).

The **code used for the initial submission** is available on two repositories, for [front-end](https://github.com/ojathelonius/let-it-fly-ui) and [back-end](https://github.com/ojathelonius/let-it-fly-ui).

## Explanation

"Let it fly" aims at finding volunteers by displaying them all the perks that they can get.

When a flight is overbooked, passengers get a notification letting them know about the situation. They can then get access to "Let it fly" and see the perks of volunteering their seat, such as free activities, hotels and restaurants.

Should they decide to volunteer, they can let the SIA staff know with a simple tap. Staff gets notified when a passengers volunteers, thus they know in real time how many seats may still need to be freed.

When the time comes, the staff can approve some or all of the passengers to free the necessary numbers of seats. Volunteering passengers can then make bookings directly through the app and continue on their journey.
